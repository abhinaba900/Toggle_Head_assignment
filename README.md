### Important development notes:

## Carousel Functionality: Please implement the carousel functionality using Swiper.js.
Your ability to integrate third-party libraries is part of this test.

## CSS Units: We recommend the use of em/rem units in CSS for better scalability and

## responsiveness. This practises is optional but valuable.

## Mobile Responsiveness: It&#39;s imperative that the webpage is mobile-responsive. This is
a crucial aspect of modern web development that we&#39;ll be evaluating.

## Top Carousel Section:
For this section, ensure users can interact seamlessly with the carousel by using
navigation dots. Additionally, enable an auto play feature to make it engaging.

## Card Slider:
The card slider should offer a smooth user experience. Users should be able to drag the
slider using both mouse and touch gestures.

## Statistics Section:
Bring the statistics to life by incorporating a counting or ticker animation. Numbers
should animate from 0 to the desired values.

## FAQ Section:
Users should have a user-friendly experience accessing answers. By clicking the plus
icon next to a question, only one answer should be visible at a time.
