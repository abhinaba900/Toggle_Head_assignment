# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Important development notes:

## Carousel Functionality: Please implement the carousel functionality using Swiper.js.
Your ability to integrate third-party libraries is part of this test.

## CSS Units: We recommend the use of em/rem units in CSS for better scalability and

## responsiveness. This practises is optional but valuable.

## Mobile Responsiveness: It&#39;s imperative that the webpage is mobile-responsive. This is
a crucial aspect of modern web development that we&#39;ll be evaluating.

## Top Carousel Section:
For this section, ensure users can interact seamlessly with the carousel by using
navigation dots. Additionally, enable an auto play feature to make it engaging.

## Card Slider:
The card slider should offer a smooth user experience. Users should be able to drag the
slider using both mouse and touch gestures.

## Statistics Section:
Bring the statistics to life by incorporating a counting or ticker animation. Numbers
should animate from 0 to the desired values.

## FAQ Section:
Users should have a user-friendly experience accessing answers. By clicking the plus
icon next to a question, only one answer should be visible at a time.
